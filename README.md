## MongoDB â†” Firestore Data Sync

This script automates the synchronization of data between MongoDB and Firestore. It connects to a MongoDB database, retrieves data from a specified collection, and ensures synchronization with a corresponding Firestore collection. The script is designed to keep both databases up-to-date.

### Prerequisites

Before running the script, ensure you have the following prerequisites:

- Node.js installed on your machine
- MongoDB instance running locally or accessible via a connection string
- Firebase project with Firestore enabled and a service account JSON file
- Postman (for testing the API)

### Installation and Setup

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/sindhusid5/booking.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the project directory:**

   ```bash
   cd booking
   ```

3. **Install dependencies:**

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

4. **Set up MongoDB:**
   - Ensure MongoDB is running locally or have a connection string to a remote MongoDB instance.
   - If you don't have MongoDB installed, download and install it from the [official MongoDB website](https://www.mongodb.com/try/download/community).

5. **Set up Firebase:**
   - Create a Firebase project at [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/).
   - Enable Firestore in your Firebase project.
   - Generate a service account JSON file from your Firebase project settings and save it in your project directory.

6. **Run the synchronization script:**

   ```bash
   node syncData.js
   ```

### Additional Notes

- **MongoDB Setup:**
  - Make sure you have a MongoDB database and collection set up with the data you want to synchronize.
  - Refer to [MongoDB Documentation](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/installation/) for detailed installation and setup instructions.

- **Firebase Setup:**
  - Follow the [Firebase Documentation](https://firebase.google.com/docs/firestore/quickstart) for creating a project and setting up Firestore.
